## **CGPA-Calculator**
This repository contains a simple C++ program that calculates the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on the user-provided grades and credit hours for multiple courses. The project demonstrates essential programming concepts such as functions, loops, and array handling in C++.

## **Project Description**
This project is a simple yet effective **CGPA Calculator** written in **C++**. It allows users to input the number of courses, the grades earned in each, and their respective credit hours. The program then computes the **Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)** and displays the result.

The project serves as a beginner-friendly example of:
- Working with **arrays**
- Passing arrays to functions
- Handling user input and arithmetic operations
